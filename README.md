# 🏡 Real Estate Listing Scraper (Mock Dataset)

This project showcases my ability to turn real-world scraping needs into sleek, scalable systems using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This script scrapes data from a mock site [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books_1/index.html) and transforms it into a structured CSV—formatted as if it's collecting real estate data. It extracts:

- 🏠 Property Address (Book Title)
- 💲 Listing Price
- 🛏️ Bedrooms (Star Rating as a proxy)

The final output is saved in `real_estate_listings.csv`—clean, organized, and ready for analysis.

## ⚙️ Tech Used

- Python 3
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas

## 📁 Output Sample

Here's a sample of the data output:

| Property Address            | Listing Price | Bedrooms |
|-----------------------------|---------------|----------|
| Sharp Objects               | £47.82        | Three    |
| A Light in the Attic        | £51.77        | Three    |
| Tipping the Velvet          | £53.74        | One      |
